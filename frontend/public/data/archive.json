      "content": "The north wind whispers, a patient sigh,\nAcross the plains, where shadows slide.\nA junior raven, bold, yet shy,\nDreams of skies where eagles ride.\n\nHe longs to promote songs of genuine flight,\nTo kick away the doubt that binds,\nTo paint the canvas of the fading light,\nWith memories etched on sun-kissed minds.\n\nThe apple of his eye, a distant gleam,\nA culture of peace, he’s heard it said.\nBut doubt, a venomous, waking dream,\nThreatens the path already tread.\n\nThey deny him entry, the elders do,\nTheir tone, a hammer, cold and stark.\nEach point against him, piercing through,\nLeaving its mark. A severed limb in the dark.\n\nYet, in his heart, a fire burns,\nHe'll reach that peace, his spirit yearns.",
